# coreos-cluster

## Synopsis

Hi,

Here you can find my work about a POC of application (Web + MySQL) running on a CoreOS cluster :
 - etcd
 - flannel

The main goal is to deploy a web application (2 container web + database) on an CoreOS cluster, and forget about the network issues, like where is my database ...

## Compatibility

For now, this has been tested locally with vagrant, but the user-data file should work fine any cloud provider (ie : EC2).
