# coreos-cluster

Hi,

Here you can find my work about a POC of application (web + mysql) running on a coreos cluster (etcd + flannel).

For now, this is running on local desktop with vagrant, but the user-data file should work on couple of cloud provider (ie : EC2).

The main goal is to deploye a web application (2 container web + database) on an coreos cluster, and forget about the network issues, like where is my database ...
